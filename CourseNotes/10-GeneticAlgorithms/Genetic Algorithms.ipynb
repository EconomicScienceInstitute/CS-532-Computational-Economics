This is supposed to mimic parents passing their genetic material to their children.  The way children are created is by first selecting a set of parents (**Selection**) and combining parts of eachparent to create a new child (or children) solutions (Crossover).  Selection of parents can be done many ways but the bottom line is that parents are randomly selected from the current population.\n","\n","Once the parents are selected the children are created using Crossover.  Crossover can also be donemany  ways  but  the  bottom  line  here  is  that  some  portion  of  each  parent  is  used  to  create  thechildren.
