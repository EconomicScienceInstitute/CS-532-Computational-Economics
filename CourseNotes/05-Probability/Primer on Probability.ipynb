Usually we describe the probability of an event x ($P(x)$) as either a percent chance or as a number between 0 and 1. These are equivalent. Take a moment to think of where you've seen someone talk about probability.\n","\n","We often talk of a percent chance of rain, percent chances of survival, x to y odds for a sports gamble. Although we talk about probability quite often, it can be hard to explain what it actualy means. Take a moment to ask yourself: What does it mean when the TV says there's a 30% chance of rain?\n","\n","That was a bad example, because meteorologists actually mean that 30% of the geographical region will experience rain during that day; however, if you went along with the thought experiment you might have arrived at a pretty good personal definition of probability. You probably said something along the lines of: \"if we had a magic wand that could recreate this day, many many times about 3/10 of the time it will rain.\"\n","\n","For the sake of this primer we can think of probability as the ratio between a desired or measured outcome and all possible outcomes. Or as I like to put it\n","\n","$P(x)=\\frac{\\text{count of stuff you want}}{\\text{count of everything}}$\n","\n","If you haven't yet, go back and try doing the warmup.\n","\n","# Properties of Probabilities\n","\n","Probabilities have certain properties that can be useful to us. We will be able to avoid using too much calculation if we rely on simulation, but it's still helpful to know these properties to verify our work. \n","\n","If you would like a refresher please feel free to read these and work through the examples with either math or code. Let's go ahead and list some:\n","\n","## 0 $\\leq$ P(x) $\\leq$ 1\n","\n","If an event is impossible it has a 0% chance of happening or P(X) = 0.\n","\n","If an event is certain it has a 100% chance of happening or P(x) = 1.\n","\n","Most events that we will deal with will be somewhere in between.
