Suppose that you can sell each chair for $3 and each table for $4, what is the best combination of chairs and tables to make? Assume you can make and sell fractional units. To turn this into an LP problem we would write:\n","\n",">>You have a budget of \\$14. Each table costs \\$2 to make and each chair costs \\$1.\n","\n","This is a budget constraint.
