OR-tools is an optimization librarby made by Google that can solve many different types of optimization problems. You can find the documentation here:\n","\n","https://developers.google.com/optimization\n","\n","The nice thing about OR tools is that it allows you to formulate problems the same accross different programming languages. I originally started using this in C# but have move to also using it in python. It is a nice API for formulating your problems but is also separated from the solver on the backend so you can plug in different solvers if you want / need (cplex or gorubi for example).\n","\n","First thing is first, let's install OR-tools.
