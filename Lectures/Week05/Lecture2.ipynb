    "You can set $T = 10$, $m = 2$. To run Monte Carlo simulations of the profit, you will need to randomly generate the number of hotels the competitor has each year. An example of a valid construction profile is: $\\{0,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,3\\}$. This can be read the following way:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- The competitor begins building on the first year and finishes construction on the second (at that point it counts as a built hotel).\r\n",
    "- The competitor starts another immediately after (year 3).\r\n",
    "- Finally, they start a third hotel in year 6.\r\n",

    "To be valid, the profile must be of length T and increment by at most one every other element (for m = 2). In the above example, the total profit over the 10 years is 3850. Find the expected profit. (Note: I will be lenient with how you sample from the space of possible competitor build profiles. Preferably, each possible profile will be equally likely.)\r\n"

    "### Conway's Game of Life\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Conway's Game of Life is a \"game\" with a simple set of rules that yields complex results. It works as follows:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- There is an NxN matrix of alive and dead cells, typically by 1's and 0's, respectively\r\n",
    "- Each cell has 8 surrounding neighbors. Cells on the edge and the corners wrap around to the other side.\r\n",
    "- Each period, the cells update according to the following rules:\r\n",
    "\t- If a dead cell has exactly 3 alive neighbors next to it, it becomes alive.\r\n",
    "\t- If an alive cell has either 2 or 3 alive neighbors next to it, it remains alive.\r\n",
    "\t- If an live cell has fewer than 2 alive neighbors next to it, it dies of loneliness.\r\n",
    "\t- If an alive cell has more than 3 alive neighbors next to it, it dies of overcrowding. Such is life.\r\n",
    "- The cells should be updated independently. So, If I am a cell, and my neighbor is currently dead it must be counted as dead to me this period, even if it turns out it will be alive next period.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Program the Game of Life. Run a test by creating a 4x4 matrix with only the 4 corners alive. The four cells should remain stationary. After the test is working, create a 50x50 matrix with each cell randomly turned on or off. Run it for 100 periods. Plot it using matplotlib.pyplot.matshow. There are many ways to display the 100 matrix plots and I will leave it up to you to find an elegant solution.\r\n"
