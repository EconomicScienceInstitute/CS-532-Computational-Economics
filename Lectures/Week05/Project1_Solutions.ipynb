        "\n",
        "An ascending clock auction is an auction where the seller starts bidding at a low price and gradually raises the price as the auction progresses. As the price increases, bidders can choose to stay in the auction (bid for the item at the clock price) or drop out and forgo their chance at winning the item. The clock price is usually raised by a fixed discrete increment. The auction ends when there is only one bidder remaining. The winning bidder gets the item and pays the posted price (clock price from the last round with multiple bidders).\n",

        "\n",
        "Example: A seller is auctioning off a baseball card. The starting auction price is \\$10 and the clock increment is \\$1. In the first round of bidding there are 5 people who place bids of \\$10. The seller then raises the price to \\$11 and bidding continues until there is only one bidder willing to pay the clock price. Say this continues until the clock price is \\$15 and there are two bidders left. If one bidder drops out, the remaining bidder wins the baseball card and pays the posted price of \\$14.\n",

        "# Solution\n",
        "So we know that when we see this problem let's identify the subproblems and write some psuedocode for their solution.\n",
        "1. Buyers - generate a list of n buyers from a uniform distribution\n",
        "2. Auction Price - find the auction clearing price for any set of parameters\n",
        "3. Monte Carlo - Run a Monte Carlo simulation with T trials that will calculate the expected value.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Buyers\n",
        "\n",
        "This can be taken care of using either random.randint(0,20)*5 or random.randrange(0,101,5). We are just going to make a list of n of these and we're done.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Auction Price\n",
        "We know or at least suspect that the auction price will vary based off of several parameters. We have some clues because the questions are asking us to change these\n",
        "\n",
        "### Parameters:\n",
        "- buyers: pretty intutive. The buyers will be bidding and will be determining the price of the auction\n",
        "- reserve: this doesn't come into play until (D) but we will keep it in mind.\n",
        "- clock increment: we should be able to change the clock increment by changing a single variable, since it's so important.\n",
        "\n",
        "So there are several ways to do this. An easy obvious way would be to use a while loop to imitate the clock and increment each step. The loop stops when there is less than 2 people remaining. This method is dependent on the max value and the clock increment.\n",
        "\n",
        "The other method is to realize equivalent outcome. If you do enough simulations you will see that the price is always the second highest price rounded down to the nearest multiple of the clock increment.\n",
        "\n",
        "When the reserve rule kicks into effect, we will then take the maximum between the two as market clearing price. If the highest bidder has a value less than the reserve price, we return 0. We are taking advantage of the increments with which the values and reserve prices are drawn\n",

        "- reserve: this doesn't come into play until (D) but we will again keep it in mind\n",
        "- clock increment: we should be able to change the clock increment with just one input, since it's so important\n",
        "- number of trials we run for monte carlo\n",
        "\n",
        "We will need an encompassing for loop to run the code T times for our Monte Carlo situation. It will generate a set of n buyers, calculate the auciton clearing price, and then append all that information to a total. We want it to be flexible and be able to vary with number of buyers, reserve price, and clock increment since those are the numbers we wish to study. If we want to go the extra mile, we should be able to change the T parameter and input whatever we want.\n",
        "\n",
        "Standard Monte Carlo stuff here. We're going to initialize a running total. We will increment it each trial and then divide the total sum by the number of trials to obtain the average. The average of the data should equal the expected value."

        "\n",
        "- There is an NxN matrix of alive and dead cells, typically by 1's and 0's, respectively\n",
        "- Each cell has 8 surrounding neighbors. Cells on the edge and the corners wrap around to the other side.\n",
        "- Each period, the cells update according to the following rules:\n",
        "\t- If a dead cell has exactly 3 alive neighbors next to it, it becomes alive.\n",
        "\t- If an alive cell has either 2 or 3 alive neighbors next to it, it remains alive.\n",
        "\t- If an live cell has fewer than 2 alive neighbors next to it, it dies of loneliness.\n",
        "\t- If an alive cell has more than 3 alive neighbors next to it, it dies of overcrowding. Such is life.\n",
        "- The cells should be updated independently. So, If I am a cell, and my neighbor is currently dead it must be counted as dead to me this period, even if it turns out it will be alive next period.\n",
        "\n",
        "Program the Game of Life. Run a test by creating a 4x4 matrix with only the 4 corners alive. The four cells should remain stationary. After the test is working, create a 50x50 matrix with each cell randomly turned on or off. Run it for 100 periods. Plot it using matplotlib.pyplot.matshow. There are many ways to display the 100 matrix plots and I will leave it up to you to find an elegant solution."
